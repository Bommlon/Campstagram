# Campstagram
a simple image-sharing website to be run locally

Designed for the [WHY2025](https://why2025.org/) dutch hacker camp.
It hosts a simple website with a vertical list of all uploaded pictures and provides a simple form for users to upload pictures and a bit of text (max 200 characters).
The description gets saved as the pictures's name and all the pictures are stored in a folder.
