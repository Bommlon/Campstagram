		Heyo &#128075 and welcome to the about page! <br>
		<br>
		This entire thing is currently being hosted by a Raspberry Pi somewhere at or near the Mysteryhack && binhacken
		village. So please be patient, it's doing its best &#129402. <br>
		<br>
		But if the site has any issues you can call me under DECT-2665 and I'll see what I can do &#128077. <br>

		You can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/Bommlon/Campstagram">GitHub</a>.
